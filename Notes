use rem_ref() for type scope in free_Namespace
make a free_Type() functions
use it in oo.h

all basic 'struct Type_' should be 'Type'; (src/type.c, include/defs.h)
in src/ and lang/
  => in include/type.h, line with 'extern struct type'
  for loop
    => transform &var in var
    =>    "      var. in var->

add_global_type:
  change argument to (name, size, parent, xid) and return Type, not m_bool
